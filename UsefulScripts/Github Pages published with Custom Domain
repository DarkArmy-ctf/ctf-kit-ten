There are some major steps for this.
And it works since it worked for me atleast.

I'll take an example of godaddy domain.

Till this point I expect you have:-
  a. A Domain bought from Godaddy
  b. A site hosted on github which you want to be seen as something.com instead of  something.github.io

1. Add the Github IPs to Godaddy DNS Manager:-
    Godaddy DNS Manager:- https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/dns?domainName=something.in
    These are 4 Github IPs:- 185.199.108.153,185.199.109.153,185.199.110.153,185.199.111.153
    Add these in A records of DNS Manager one by one like this.
    There will be by default "parked" as placeholder, replace it by one of your IPs.


      Type    Name    	Value   	          TTL   	
      A     	@     	185.199.108.153	      600 seconds	
      
      
    After that again,Click on Add and
        select Type as A, host as @ and Points as the other three IPs one after other
        and in The TTL select custom option and set it as 600 instead on 3600 seconds.
2. Now go to the root directory of your github.io page and create a new file named "CNAME" and in the file,write your domain
   name i.e something.in. And keep in mind that there should be no extra space of new line character in the end
3.Now You can load your url something.io and it will open like charm. But it will open as http,so now as last step we will add
  the https.
4.Enforcing HTTPS for your GitHub Pages site otherwise by default they will be http
    On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.
    Under your repository name, click  Settings.
    Under "GitHub Pages," select Enforce HTTPS.
5. You are done now.

Enjoy !!
